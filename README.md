Simple Minesweeping Game

## How to Play

Dig squares to reveal its content. If it is a number, then it shows how many
neighbour tiles have bombs. If the tile has no bombs around it, the game will
automatically dig until it finds tiles with bombs around them.

If you are sure a tile has a bomb, you can flag it.

The game ends when you flag all bombs correctly or you dig a bomb.

There are four difficulty levels in total.
